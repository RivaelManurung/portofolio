        description: "As a back-end engineer, I focus on creating and maintaining the server-side parts of applications to ensure they work well with the front end. I work with various programming languages like Node.js, PHP, Java and Golang, and have a lot of experience using the Laravel framework. I also contribute to the whole development process of projects. In addition to back-end skills, I know front-end development with React JS and manage SQL databases effectively. I follow best practices in software development to build scalable and efficient systems, manage databases well, and perform thorough testing. My commitment to quality has led to reliable back-end solutions that improve overall system performance and provide a good user experience. Overall, I aim to connect the front and back ends smoothly, creating a cohesive and efficient application environment.",
